# peka-vm-api

This repository contains a reverse-engineered description of the API used to
communicate with the "Virtual Monitor" used by the Poznań Mass Transit in order
to provide ETA of vehicles at their respective stops.

Since I believe this is relevant only to Polish users (and, possibly, residents
of Poznań), the information is provided in Polish. I will gladly provide a
translation should anyone ever need it.
